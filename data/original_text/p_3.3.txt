For many years, I obsessed over the “hedonic treadmill” and “cruel optimism” and all these other catchy phrases for feeling bad about achievement culture. What’s the point of working so hard for what you want, if you’ll simply adjust your expectations and revert to the mean after? What if the system is designed on purpose to keep us from success? But it’s Nguyen who gave me peace of mind: These questions are inverted. I don’t play in order to hit the goals; I set goals so I can play.

It’s about the journey, not the destination. The view is always prettiest after a backbreaking hike; the meal tastes better when you’ve prepared it yourself. I tend to get restless when things are easy. Have I ever accomplished anything effortlessly that I’ve really, truly liked? Is an important part of the process feeling like I might die along the way? 

Of course, we ought to pick the right games to play, ensure that we struggle toward the right kinds of ends. There’s nothing that makes me sadder than watching a friend bust ass for a job or relationship that doesn’t enrich them. Effort must lead to reward. The feedback loops have to work out. There was this essay on competitive math that spread around my Twitter circles lately. The author mourns the pointlessness of the activity, the divergence between the math problems that get you into college and the math problems that push the field forward. I think the problem was actually that he didn’t like the game enough. I have an old rule for myself: Never spend time on something I’d end up regretting if it didn’t lead to the outcome I hoped for.
