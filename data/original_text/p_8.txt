On New Year’s Eve, in the last hours of 2018, New Horizons speeds past a small object inside the Kuiper Belt called Ultima Thule. Everything goes exactly as planned, though it takes nearly seven hours for information from the probe to travel at the speed of light to mission leaders at NASA.

What will change, now that we know something exists in that deep and dark expanse? New knowledge rarely changes our understanding of the things we think we know best. Even as Saturn’s rings rain down upon it, I only see the planet with its beloved bronze discs cutting across its center, an image frozen in time.

I wonder, for the ones who know me best, which version of me they see after all this time. Am I for them like my mother is to me, both new and familiar, someone more fully herself? In long friendships, memories blend together. The women I love are then and now and once and will be. I look to the stars and wonder how old they are, wonder how long ago they were, but the fates of those stars don’t matter. For now, it is enough that they are.
